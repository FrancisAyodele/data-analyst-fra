### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
# Project Description: Performing EDA on Workforce Pay Rates and Gender Dataset.
# Project Title: Reviewing Equity in Workforce Pay: An Exploratory Data Analysis
# Objective: This main aim of this analysis is to understand patterns and trends and extract insights about salary distribution and workforce categories and gender equality from the City of Vancouver Workforce Pay Rates and Gender dataset.
# Dataset: The components of the dataset includes:
      * Year (2019 -  2023)
      * Exempt/Union status
      * Classification and position titles
      * Hourly pay rates (Minimum, Maximum)
      * Gender or Sex demographics (Female, Male, Total)
# Methodology: 
1. Data Collection and Preparation
     * Ingested the CSV dataset into Amazon S3 (Raw bucket).
     * Ensured the CSV file was accessible for further profiling and cleaning (see Figure 1 below).
**Figure 1**: Downloaded Workforce Dataset (CSV) in S3

3. Descriptive Summaries
     * Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for the numerical columns (Minimum and Maximum Hourly Rate, Female, Male, Total).
     * Counted the frequency distribution of classification types and union/exempt categories.
4. Data Visualization
* Created basic charts (box plots, bar charts) to reveal distributions of hourly rates and how they differ across classification types and years.
