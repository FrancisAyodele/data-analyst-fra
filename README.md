Dataset: Workforce Pay Rates and Gender for the City of Vancouver from 2019 to 2023
# Portfolio Overview: To describes the processes of analyzing Workforce Pay Rates and Gender data from the City of Vancouver implemented through AWS Cloud Computing services

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
# Project Description: Performing EDA on Workforce Pay Rates and Gender Dataset.
# Project Title: Reviewing Equity in Workforce Pay: An Exploratory Data Analysis
# Objective: This main aim of this analysis is to understand patterns and trends and extract insights about salary distribution and workforce categories and gender equality from the City of Vancouver Workforce Pay Rates and Gender dataset.
# Dataset: The components of the dataset includes:
      * Year (2019 -  2023)
      * Exempt/Union status
      * Classification and position titles
      * Hourly pay rates (Minimum, Maximum)
      * Gender or Sex demographics (Female, Male, Total)
# Methodology: 
1. Data Collection and Preparation
     * Ingested the CSV dataset into Amazon S3 (Raw bucket).
     * Ensured the CSV file was accessible for further profiling and cleaning (see Figure 1 below).

2. Initial ProfilinG
Used AWS Glue DataBrew to generate statistics on data completeness, duplicates, min/max values, and potential outliers. This step informed the potential corrections needed during the cleaning phase.

3. Descriptive Summaries
     * Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for the numerical columns (Minimum and Maximum Hourly Rate, Female, Male, Total).
     * Counted the frequency distribution of classification types and union/exempt categories.
4. Data Visualization
* Created basic charts (box plots, bar charts) to reveal distributions of hourly rates and how they differ across classification types and years.

5-	Insights and Findings:
     * Summarize the findings based on data visualizations and statistical analyses
     * Highlight of notable trends and patterns (e.g., women and children had higher survival rates, first-class passengers had a significant survival advantage).


# Tools and Technologies:
     * AWS S3 for data ingestion
     * AWS Glue DataBrew for profiling and cleaning
     * Microsoft Excel CSV file for exploratory charts
